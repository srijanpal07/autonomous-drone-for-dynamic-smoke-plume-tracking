# Autonomous-Drone-for-Dynamic-Smoke-Plume-Tracking
This repository features an autonomous drone-based smoke plume tracking system for unsteady conditions. Built on a quadrotor with Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, it uses PID and PPO-based DRL controllers for real-time adaptation. Tested in Unreal Engine simulations and field tests, it has applications in wildfire management and air quality monitoring.
