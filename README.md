# Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking
This repository features the code base for the "Autonomous Drone for Dynamic Smoke Plume Tracking" project. Built on a quadrotor with Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, it uses PID and PPO-based DRL controllers for real-time smoke tracking in unsteady wind conditions. Tested in Unreal Engine simulations and field tests, it has applications in wildfire management and air quality monitoring.
